Simple Cocoa Touch Singleton class with queue example.
For ARC enabled environment only.

Based on "USING THE SINGLETON PATTERN IN OBJECTIVE-C PART 2" from Fred McCann.
This class is improved. You can call init method more times and object with stay in consistent state because initialization is allowed only once.
